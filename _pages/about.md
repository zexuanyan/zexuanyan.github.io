Hello! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering with a minor in business at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (graduating in May 2026). My interest mainly lies in hardware verification, digital logic design, and computer architecture. 

I love learning new things through hands-on work, and I believe doing projects is one of the best ways to learn! I’ve worked on projects like taping out a custom FPGA from the ground up with a small team, building a RISC-V Out-of-Order processor with advanced features, and writing a Python-to-Verilog generator using Python’s AST. I’ve also done hands-on RTL design, timing analysis, and scripting to speed up tool flows. I enjoy working where hardware meets software and love building things that are both elegant and efficient. Check out the Project Tab to see all projects I've done! 

<!-- Fun facts about myself: I was born in China and came to the States when I was fourteen, I'm a big fan of 70s' and 80s' rock, and I went to the Rubik's Cube World Championship at Paris in 2017. [Here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016YANZ04) are my Rubik's Cube competition records if you are interested! Other than that, I really enjoy playing electrical guitar, cooking (as demostrated on the right), and baking desserts! -->
