Hello! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (graduating in May 2026). My interest mainly lies in computer architecture, electrical hardware (MCUs, PCBs, etc.) design, and high performance computing. I love learning new things through hands-on work, and I believe doing projects is one of the best ways to learn! Checkout the Project Tab to see all projects I've done! 

Fun facts about myself: I was born in China and came to the States when I was fourteen, I'm a big fan of 70s' and 80s' rock, and I went to the Rubik's Cube World Championship at Paris in 2017. [Here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016YANZ04) are my Rubik's Cube competition records if you are interested! Other than that, I really enjoy playing electrical guitar, cooking (as demostrated on the right), and baking desserts!
